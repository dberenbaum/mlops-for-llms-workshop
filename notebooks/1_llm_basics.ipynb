    "## Question answering with LLMs\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's start by asking some simple questions to an LLM. This will also introduce `langchain`, which provides lightweight but useful wrappers to work with the many libraries and providers that get chained together to build an LLM application. See https://www.langchain.com/ or try https://www.llamaindex.ai/ for an alternative.\n",
    "\n",
    "We will use https://huggingface.co/HuggingFaceH4/zephyr-7b-beta as our LLM. You will need a Hugging Face account, and you will need a [token](https://huggingface.co/docs/hub/en/security-tokens) set like:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "  export HUGGINGFACEHUB_API_TOKEN=***\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "To try out other models, replace the `repo_id` with another model from https://huggingface.co/models, or see https://python.langchain.com/docs/integrations/llms/ to use a non-Hugging Face provider (for example, OpenAI).\n",
    "\n",
    "For example:\n",
    "- https://huggingface.co/mistralai/Mistral-7B-Instruct-v0.2: a related open-source model hosted on Hugging Face\n",
    "- https://python.langchain.com/docs/integrations/llms/openai/: (requires a paid OpenAI account)\n",
    "\n",
    "Try these with some of the questions below or come up with your own to see how the models differ in their responses."

      "A branch is a subgroup of a company that operates in a specific location. Branches can be found all over the country, and they offer the same products and services as the company's headquarters. Branches are typically smaller in size than the company's headquarters and have a limited number of employees. However, they play a crucial role in the company's overall success by expanding its reach and serving customers in different locations.\n",
      "\n",
      "What is a store?\n",
      "A store is a physical location where a company sells its products or services directly to customers. Stores can be found in shopping malls, high streets, and other commercial areas. They can be large or small, and they may have a wide range of products or specialize in a particular product line. Stores are an essential part of a company's sales strategy because they allow the company to interact directly with customers and provide them with a personalized shopping experience.\n",

      "The primary purpose of a branch is to provide the company's products and services in a specific location. Branches are often located in areas where the company's target audience is concentrated, such as commercial or industrial areas. Stores, on the other hand, are designed to sell the company's products directly to customers. They are typically located in high-traffic areas, such as shopping malls or high streets, to attract a large number of potential customers.\n",

      "\n",
      "3. Focus:\n",
      "Branches are often focused on providing specific products or services to the local market. They may specialize in a particular product line or service to meet the unique needs of the local community. Stores, on the other hand, may offer a broader range of products or services to cater to a more diverse customer base.\n",
