However, it is limited to matching words and has no concept of the actual meaning of the question or documents. Notice that some of the documents are not that relevant to the question.\n",

When a question is asked, it gets encoded into a vector using the same embedding model. Then, the distance between that question vector and all saved document vectors in the index is calculated using cosine similarity or a similar metric. The documents with the smallest distance from the question vector are returned as the relevant context.\n",
