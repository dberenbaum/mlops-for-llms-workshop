      "Suppose you’re done with a remote branch — say, you and your collaborators are finished with a feature and have merged it into your remote’s main branch (or whatever branch your stable code-line is in). You can delete a remote branch using the rather obtuse syntax git push [remotename] :[branch]. If you want to delete your serverfix branch from the server, you run the following:\n",

A way to remember this command is by recalling the git push [remotename] [localbranch]:[remotebranch] syntax that we went over a bit earlier. If you leave off the [localbranch] portion, then you’re basically saying, “Take nothing on my side and make it be [remotebranch].”\n",

      "Question: I accidentally committed the wrong files to Git, but didn't push the commit to the server yet.\n",
      "How do I undo those commits from the local repository?\n",
      "Answer:  To undo commits from the local repository without pushing them to the server, you can use the command git restore . This is an alternative to git reset, which was covered earlier. The command git restore . Undoes commits by replacing the current file with the last staged or committed version. It's important to note that using this command will permanently remove any unsaved local changes, so use it with caution. If you want to keep changes but still get them out of the way for now, you can use stashing or branching, which are generally better ways to go. However, anything that is committed in Git can almost always be recovered, while anything that is lost and never committed is likely never to be seen again. To automate the workflow, you can configure Git by adding a remote repository, fetching branches, setting upstream-to, and defining the default push repository. This simplifies the workflow, but it's important to remember that Git won't warn you if you commit directly to master, since that branch effectively belongs to the upstream repository. To unstage a staged file, you can use the command git restore --staged <file> or git reset HEAD <file> to unstage the file. The command git restore <file> can be used to discard changes in the working directory.\n",

If the branch is not found, try deleting the local branch with `git branch -d origin/bugfix`. Once the local branch is deleted, delete the remote branch with `git push origin :refs/heads/bugfix` or `git push origin --delete bugfix`. Afterwards, check if the branch still exists with `git pull` and if it is still present, delete it again with `git push origin --delete bugfix`.

      "Git pull and Git fetch both retrieve data from a remote repository, but they have some differences:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. Git fetch: This command retrieves the data from a remote repository and updates the local repository's reference branches, but it does not merge any changes into the current branch. It is used to fetch changes from a remote branch without affecting the current branch.\n",

      "1. Make sure you're on the branch you want to rename.\n",
      "2. Run the following command:\n",
      "   git branch -m old_branch_name new_branch_name\n",
      "3. Confirm that the branch name has been changed by listing your branches:\n",

This will remove the changes from the staging area and they will not be included in the next commit. However, this will not undo the changes you made to the file itself, you will need to use 'git checkout myfile.txt' to discard the changes made to the file and restore its previous state.

The error message \"error: Untracked working tree file 'example.txt' would be overwritten by merge\" indicates that the local file 'example.txt' will be overwritten by the changes from the remote repository during the merge process.

Then, to check out the branch locally, run `git checkout <branch_name>`, replacing `<branch_name>` with the name of the branch you want to check out (in this case, `test`). If the branch does not exist locally, Git will create it for you and checkout the branch at the same time. If the branch does exist locally and is already checked out, Git will switch to that branch. If the branch does not exist locally and is already checked out, Git will print an error message. If you want to force-checkout the branch, you can add the `--force` flag to the `git checkout` command. However, this should be done with caution, as it can overwrite any local changes you have made to the branch.
